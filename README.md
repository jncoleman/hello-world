Blah, blah, blah! You know some people want to get rid of the 'Oxford comma.' For those of you who don't know it's the last comma that comes in a list of items. It's nothing special, but I think that it combines the last two items in the list in an unnatural way, clumping them together instead of keeping each item at an equal distance. It's not too important, but I will still use it. Anyway, I digress.

This is my first edit to a document. The document will be differnt from the master document, so I can make functionality changes, or any type really, and after they work I will recombine it with the master document. A nice feature.
